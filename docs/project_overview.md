# Jarv1s: Project Overview

## What is Jarv1s?

Jarv1s is a conversational AI assistant designed to run completely on your local machine, without depending on cloud services. Its name is a tribute to JARVIS from Iron Man, but with a radical focus on privacy and user control.

## Project Philosophy

### Privacy First
- **100% Local**: No personal data, conversations, or files leave your computer
- **No telemetry**: No tracking, metrics, or external analytics
- **Total control**: You decide which models to use and how to configure the system

### Learning and Experimentation
This project was born as a learning laboratory to explore:
- Agentic AI systems
- Multi-agent architectures
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Local AI model integration

## Current Capabilities (Functional Prototype)

### âœ… Implemented
- **Fluid voice conversation**: Web interface with push-to-talk
- **Speech-to-Text**: Accurate transcription using Whisper
- **Language processing**: Local LLM via LM Studio
- **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice with Piper TTS
- **Conversational memory**: Maintains context between exchanges
- **Client-server architecture**: React Frontend + FastAPI Backend

### ðŸ”„ In Development
- Integration with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Extensible tools system
- Local web search
- PDF document processing

### ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Vision
- **Productivity assistant**: Calendar management, notes, tasks
- **Intelligent researcher**: Document analysis, information synthesis
- **Customizable copilot**: Adaptable to specific workflows

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Backend (Python)**
- FastAPI + Uvicorn for REST API
- OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text
- Piper TTS for voice synthesis
- LiteLLM as universal LLM connector
- FFmpeg for audio processing

**Frontend (React)**
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Framer Motion for animations
- Axios for HTTP communication
- MediaRecorder API for audio capture

**AI Inference**
- LM Studio as local LLM server
- GGUF models optimized for CPU/GPU

### Data Flow

```
User speaks â†’ Whisper (STT) â†’ Local LLM â†’ Piper (TTS) â†’ User hears
                     â†‘                â†“
                Audio WAV        Text + Context
```

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Functional Prototype âœ…

The project has reached its first important milestone: an end-to-end system that enables natural voice conversations. The base architecture is validated and robust.

**Next Steps**:
1. Migration to Google ADK for agentic capabilities
2. Development of specialized tools
3. Performance optimization
4. User experience improvements

## Use Cases

### Current
- Basic conversational assistant
- Proof of concept for local AI
- Model experimentation platform

### Future
- Personal productivity assistant
- Research and analysis tool
- Developer copilot
- Home automation system

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Absolute privacy**: No external dependencies
2. **Total customization**: Adaptable models and configuration
3. **Low latency**: Local processing without network
4. **Transparency**: Open source and auditable
5. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture for new capabilities

## System Requirements

### Minimum
- Python 3.11+
- 8GB RAM
- Modern CPU (recommended: 4+ cores)
- 5GB disk space

### Recommended
- 16GB+ RAM
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional)
- SSD for better performance
- Quality microphone and speakers

## Contribution and Development

This is an open-source project focused on learning. Contributions are welcome, especially in:
- New tools and capabilities
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements
- Documentation and tutorials

The project serves as a practical case study to understand how to build modern conversational AI systems without compromising user privacy.
